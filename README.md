<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Anthony</h1>

I'm a Computer Science graduate from the University of Toronto, passionate about artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analysis. Below are some of the projects I've enjoyed working on:

---

## 🌟 Featured Projects

### 🏝️ Animal Crossing Villager Popularity Prediction & Recommender
A personal machine learning system focused on predicting and recommending villagers in Animal Crossing: New Horizons.
- Built a model to predict villager popularity using both categorical features and CLIP-based visual embeddings.
- Implemented a similarity-based recommender that lets users input a few favorite villagers and get tailored suggestions.
- Wrapped it all in a Streamlit app so users can explore and visualize both predictions and recommendations.
- **Tech Stack:** Python, scikit-learn, OpenAI CLIP, Streamlit, pandas, NumPy

### 📷 Cilindir (CSC301)
A student-led university project built in collaboration with a startup aimed at improving remote collaboration using immersive VR and 3D reconstruction.
- Collaborated with a team of 7 across three subteams: pose estimation, 3D reconstruction, and Unreal Engine.
- On the 3D reconstruction team, I implemented a pipeline that transformed camera-based pose data into realistic 3D human models using PIFuHD.
- The final goal: allow users to interact in virtual meetings as lifelike avatars rather than flat video tiles.
- **Tech Stack:** Python, PyTorch, PIFuHD, COLMAP, OpenCV

## 🛠️ Other Projects

#### 📚 Bargain Bin Quizlet (CSC207)
- A Java-based flashcard study app with user authentication, flashcard editing, public set search, and quizzes.  
- Created in a team of 8 as part of CSC207 Software Design.
- **Tech Stack:** Java

#### 🌱 ProtoPlant  
- An Arduino-powered agricultural robot that monitors plant health (soil temp, humidity, light) and displays data via a web dashboard.  
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Arduino, JavaScript, HTML/CSS

#### 🎲 Chinese Checkers AI  
- A high school project where I implemented an AI for playing Chinese Checkers using board evaluation and best-move selection.
- **Tech Stack:** Java

#### 👽 Untitled Maze Game  
- A 3D sci-fi horror game featuring raycasting, A* pathfinding, and a networked multiplayer mode.  
- **Tech Stack:** Java

#### 💠 Square Run  
- A 2D rhythm game inspired by Geometry Dash, complete with custom visuals, music, and procedurally generated levels.  
- **Tech Stack:** Python, pygame

#### 🐐 Goatman's Game  
- A horror-themed 2D platformer featuring a timed day/night cycle and spooky lore.
- **Tech Stack:** Java
